## Dataset

### Ongoing Construction Site Dataset
Our dataset includes various data collections from the area around the construction site, showing the ongoing construction process. This enables researchers to evaluate place recognition algorithms in dynamic environments with changing conditions.

### Sensor Configuration
The handheld system with a monocular camera and a 3D solid-state LiDAR was used to acquire sensor data. In addition, we have also attached an IMU and GPS to the system to enable its utilization for other purposes (e.g., visual-inertial odometry, LiDAR-inertial odometry).

| Sensor     | Manufacturer | Model           | Description                                                       | Hz  |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| RGB Camera | Intel        | RealSense D435i | Global shutter RGB-D camera, (640,480) resolution               | 30  |
| 3D LiDAR   | Livox        | Mid-70          | Scanning LiDAR, circular FOV of  70.4&deg;             | 10  |
| IMU        | MicroStrain  | 3DM-GX5-AHRS    | High performing Attitude and Heading Reference System             | 250 |
| GPS        | u-blox       | ZED-F9P         | Multi-band GNSS receiver providing centimeter level accurate pose | 10  |

- RGB Camera
	- The monocular images acquired at 30Hz are stored in **Camera** folder. Each image is named by its timestamp.
- 3D LiDAR
	- 3D LiDAR data is stored in **LiDAR** folder in floating point binary format. Each binary file is named by its timestamp.
	- The data format follows the Livox custom pointcloud format. For more detailed information, please refer to this <a href="https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_ros_driver/blob/master/livox_ros_driver/msg/CustomPoint.msg">link</a>.
- IMU
	- **'imu.csv'** stores the orientation, angular velocity and linear acceleration data measured by IMU sensor.
	- [time_stamp, quaternion x, quaternion y, quaternion z, quaternion w, angular velocity x, angular velocity y, angular velocity z, linear acceleration x, linear acceleration y, linear acceleration z]	
- Pose (SLAM + GPS)
  - RTK did not function properly due to the presence of numerous tall buildings, and raw GPS experienced difficulties when passing under the bridge. Furthermore, the outdoor setting prevented us from using a laser scanner for ground truth generation.
  - Therefore, we provide positions that represents a path of the handheld systme as ground truth information in local IMU coordinate, generated using SLAM.
  - The positions for each sequence were generated using <a href="https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST_LIO">FAST-LIO2</a>, and then transformed into a reference IMU frame using GPS measurement and G-ICP, which utilized only the static regions.
  - The ground truth information can be found in the **'pose.csv'**.
  - [time_stamp, x, y, z]
- DataStamp
	- **'data_stamp.csv'** provide the timestamps and the names of all sensor data in order.
	- File Player needs **'data_stamp.csv'** to publish sensor data in order.  
- Calibration Data
	- The calibration results between the sensors are stored in **Calibration** folder.
